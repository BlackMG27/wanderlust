## Introduction

Study abroad semesters can be incredible experiences. But with so many options, it can be overwhelming for students to find the trip thatâ€™s right for them. Introducing Wanderlust. Travel around the globe with the click of a mouse. Read real reviews from real students in the countries that you want to visit. Take a trip you trust with Wanderlust

We wanted to create an interactive website where people could share their experiences. For the design of our app, we planned to create an interactive, responsive map as our centerpiece. This map automatically updates whenever a review for a new country is added to our database. We hope this site could become a resource for study abroad offices at schools around the country

## User Guide
